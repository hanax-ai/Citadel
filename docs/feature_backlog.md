- Develop text cleaning and preprocessing utilities
- Add support for handling different content types (text, tables, lists)
- Create content validation and quality checks

### 3. Ollama LLM Integration
- Set up Ollama client connection and configuration
- Implement basic prompt templates for document processing
- Create text chunking and context management utilities
- Add error handling and retry mechanisms for LLM calls

### 4. Qdrant Vector Database Setup

## Prioritization Criteria

Features in the Current phase are prioritized based on:
1. Foundation requirement (needed by other components)
2. Technical risk (addressing high-risk areas early)
3. Value delivery (providing usable functionality quickly)

As development progresses, this backlog will be refined and reprioritized based on feedback, technical discoveries, and evolving requirements.

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Git
- Node.js (v16+)
- Your preferred code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Docker (for containerization)
- Database of choice (PostgreSQL recommended)

### Quick Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/project-citadel.git
   cd project-citadel
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your local configuration
   ```

4. **Initialize the database**
   ```bash
   # If using Docker
   docker-compose up -d db
   
   # Run migrations
   npm run migrate
   ```

5. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Feature-by-Feature Development Approach

### Development Workflow

1. **Select a feature** from the milestone list
2. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/feature-name
   ```
3. **Implement the feature** with these sub-steps:
   - Create necessary database models/migrations
   - Implement backend logic/API endpoints
   - Develop frontend components
   - Add unit tests
4. **Test locally**
5. **Commit changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Implement feature: feature-name"
   ```
6. **Push and merge**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/feature-name
   # Create PR or merge directly for solo development
   ```
7. **Move to next feature**

### Feature Implementation Template

For each feature, follow this structure:

```
/feature-name
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/         # Database models
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ controllers/    # Business logic
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ routes/         # API endpoints
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/     # UI components
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/          # Unit tests
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md       # Feature documentation
```

## Solo/Small-Team Development Practices

### Daily Routine
- **Morning review** (10-15 min): Check what you accomplished yesterday and plan today's work
- **Development blocks** (2-3 hours): Focus on implementation with minimal interruptions
- **End-of-day checkpoint** (10 min): Document progress and identify blockers

### Communication (for small teams)
- Use a simple shared document or Trello board to track progress
- Brief check-ins via chat/call when needed (avoid scheduled meetings)
- Document decisions and important information in a central location

### Version Control Practices
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- For solo development, you can work directly on the main branch if preferred
- For small teams, use feature branches and simple PRs

### Time Management
- Focus on one feature at a time
- Allocate time blocks for specific tasks
- Set realistic daily goals (1-2 significant advancements per day)

## Testing Approach

### Unit Testing
- Write tests alongside feature development
- Focus on critical business logic and edge cases
- Aim for 70-80% coverage of core functionality

```javascript
// Example test structure
describe('Feature: User Authentication', () => {
  it('should register a new user with valid credentials', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
  
  it('should reject registration with invalid email', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

### Manual Testing Checklist
- Create a simple checklist for each feature
- Test on your primary development environment
- Document edge cases and potential issues

### Continuous Integration
- Set up a basic GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
- Run tests on push to main branch
- Automate linting and code quality checks

## Lightweight Backlog Management

### Backlog Structure
Maintain a simple `backlog.md` file with the following sections:

```markdown
## Current Sprint
- [ ] Feature X: Brief description
- [ ] Feature Y: Brief description

## Up Next
- Feature Z: Brief description
- Bug fix: Description of the issue

## Future Considerations
- Idea 1: Brief description
- Idea 2: Brief description
```

### Prioritization
- Focus on features that deliver the most value first
- Consider dependencies between features
- Balance new features with technical debt and bug fixes

### Backlog Refinement
- Review the backlog weekly
- Move items between sections as needed
- Add details to upcoming features as they become clearer

### Feature Tracking
For each feature, maintain a simple status:
- üîÑ In Progress
- ‚úÖ Completed
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Paused
- üîú Up Next

## Deployment and Demo Checkpoints

### Simple Deployment Process
1. Merge completed features to main branch
2. Run the build process
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
3. Deploy to staging environment
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:staging
   ```
4. Verify functionality
5. Deploy to production when ready
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:prod
   ```

### Demo Checkpoints
- After completing each milestone, prepare a simple demo
- Document key features with screenshots or short videos
- Self-review the implementation against requirements
- Note any technical debt or future improvements

## Conclusion

This streamlined approach focuses on practical development while maintaining just enough structure to keep the project organized. Adjust the processes as needed based on your specific workflow preferences and project requirements.

Remember that the goal is to maximize productive coding time while minimizing process overhead. Good luck with Project Citadel!
